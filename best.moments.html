      <div class="bmtext">Madara Uchiha
    is one of the main antagonists in Naruto.
    He was a legendary ninja who lived many years
    prior to the current timeline of the series. For a long time,
    Madaras powers remained a mystery, but that changed towards 
  the end of the series.

Madara finally appeared during the Fourth Great Ninja War as he was reanimated by Kabuto. He appeared at the top of a giant rock and t
hen he proceeded to destroy an entire platoon of ninjas.</div></p></span>

      <div class="bmtext">The first episode of an anime series is one of the most important episodes because it is what will convince a viewer to continue watching. In this regard, the Fall of Shiganshina was an excellent introduction to Attack on Titan because it provided more than enough excitement to satisfy even the most jaded of viewers. However, it should be noted that the attack of the Armored Titan and the Colossal Titan served other useful purposes from an out-of-series perspective as well.</div></p></span>

  <div class="bmtext">This moment is easily one of the most iconic moments in anime history. Goku's anger towards Frieza for hurting his friends, and his desperate desire to stop Frieza's destruction fueled him to unlock his hidden potential.

Since the beginning of the series, the Super Saiyan transformation has been considered legendary. It was once thought to be unattainable by every Saiyan, so this scene represented Goku achieving the unachievable.</p></span>

When the Phantom Troupe noticed the duo, there was a moment where fear encapsulated the entire space. The zoom effect on both Gon and Killua's eyes was used to portray the dread they felt after being caught.</p></span>

  <div class="bmtext">This moment has been highly anticipated since the beginning of the series. Manga readers could not wait to see how MAPPA was going to animate the moment when took off his blindfold. Without a doubt, MAPPA definitely did not disappoint.

This very moment in the anime also made fans 'simp' for the Jujutsu sorcerer. His eyes that seem to resemble the sky are thought to be some of the best-looking eyes in the anime world.</p></span>

  <div class="bmtext">This moment left everyone's mouth wide open. Fans witnessed Rock Lee's Taijutsu prowess before his match with Gaara. After he took off his extra weights, he became even more powerful and moved at lightning speed.

When he took off his weights, everyone thought they would be a couple of pounds at most, but to their surprise, there were large plumes of dirt. This is seen is one of the best moments in all of Naruto.</p></span>

Its the sinister transformation that portrays how he won’t forgive those who do him harm. The development that built up this intense moment clearly showed that Pitous days were numbered.</p></span>

  The Samurai are left in awe as Luffy destroys the Tori Gate and clears the hurdle for the samurai to raid Onigashima.There was also a lot of One Piece's characteristic joy in this episode. The hilarious subtext of Kinemon being a single-brain-celled goofus re: his “plans” was great fun, especially the back and forth with Raizo.

    <p class="homepagep"><span style="color:white">For practically half an episode, Naruto and Sasuke battle Momoshiki after he tries to absorb Narutos chakra. The animation is gorgeous. The choreography is outstanding. Theres big techniques and clever moves and even a callback to their fight with Zabuza. Best of all, theres very little to break up the action! Its one of the best Naruto fights period, and the fact that its Naruto and Sasuke working together is icing on an already delicious cake! While Boruto is ultimately one the one to finish Momoshiki off, he never could have done it if his dad, his sensei, and the animators, didnt go all out.</p></span>
